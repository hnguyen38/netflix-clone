# Netflix Clone

This Netflix Clone uses The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) as an API for movie/TV show information. Postman (https://web.postman.co/) is used to get an API key. Youtube and Movietrailer packages were used to retrieve and search for trailers with given title.

### Features

- Click on images (banner not included) to get a trailer
- More Info in banner will bring a popup with trailer and overview
- horizontal scroll buttons to look through movies/shows
- Browser routing for each category in Navigation Bar
- Each refresh renews the banner

## Installation

This project uses Yarn.

1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/), this uses v17.7.1. npm package manager comes with Node.js.
2. Install Yarn using npm. In terminal type: npm install --global yarn
3. Yarn is version 3.1.1 and npm is version 8.2.0
4. Check the version by typing one of these at a time in the terminal: npm -v, yarn -v, or node -v
5. Using git bash, type "yarn start" to open the application in browser.

### Project Status

Developement has completely stopped for now. Going back to this, I would find another way to get movie trailers because some do not link to the correct trailer of the given show.
